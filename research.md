We compute the arithmetic rank of nullcone ideals arising from the classical actions of the symplectic group, the general linear group, and the orthogonal group. We use these arithmetic rank calculations to establish striking vanishing results on the local cohomology modules supported at these nullcone ideals. This is done by analyzing the integer torsion in the critical local cohomology modules. The vanishing theorems that we obtain are sharp in multiple ways.
