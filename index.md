I am a second year graduate student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.unl.edu) at the [University of Nebraska — Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu). I am advised by [Eloísa Grifo](https://eloisagrifo.github.io) and [Jack Jeffries](https://jack-jeffries.github.io). Broadly speaking, I am primarily interested in commutative algebra and homological algebra and their interactions with algebraic geometry.
